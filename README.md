Very simple Discord bot that just shows the unioulu menus for the day by calling it using command !menu in discord.
It will provide then respond with a markdown message for example: 

![kuva](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e4ba931-4927-4d37-9f45-09b66b20d0eb)


To use it you need to create a dotenv file (.env) that contains your own github API key in the following format:
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<API_KEY>
